# Implementation-of-HDLC-Protocol
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is a bit-oriented code transparent synchronous data link 
layer protocol developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). HDLC is 
used to connect one device to another. HDLC Protocol is used to send the data in the form of frames; a controller controls the flow of 
data in the data link layer of the OSI model. HDLC protocol is used to transmit frames in the 
logic link layer of the Data link Layer.
